# Intake-esm Datastore

This repository is where intake-esm's official data collection/catalog files live.

[`intake-esm`](https://github.com/NCAR/intake-esm) is used to ingest assets from these collections/catalogs into xarray datasets.

## Create conda environment

```bash
conda env update -f environment.yaml
```

Once the environment creation step is done, activate the created environment:

```bash
conda activate esm-catalog-builder
```
